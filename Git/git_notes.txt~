Pulling up records/logs
    * git log
        - all commits with general information
    * git show HEAD~X
        - show commits and changes at X number of commits before HEAD
    * git annotate commithash
        - shows detailed description of changes for particular hash

Unstaging changes
    * git checkout -- filename
        - gets rid of unstaged changes in filename
        - replace filename with "." and you revert back to original state of most recent commit 
    * git reset HEAD -- filename
        - gets rid of staged changes in filename
        - replace filename with "." and you revert back to original state of most recent commit

Checking differences
    * between branches: git diff branch1 branch2
    * between branches and particular file: git diff branch1 branch2 -- filename

Reverting back to past commits
    * git checkout hash filename
        - goes back to file at certain commit hash

Reconciling merge conflicts
    * it's actually really simple, just go on atom or something and choose whichever change is better
    * once all changes are made, add the files that were flagged for merge conflicts then:
        - git merge
    * voila, now you can push
