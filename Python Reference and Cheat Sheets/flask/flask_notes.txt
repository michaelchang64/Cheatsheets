Creating a new Flask Project
    1. Make a virtual environment (with requirements.txt to contain all necessary packages)
        a. mkdir projectname
        b. cd projectname
        c. python -m venv venv
        * to activate virtual environment, use 'source venv/bin/activate'
        * to deactivate, simply execute 'deactivate'

    2. Create a flask app named simply 'main.py' or 'app.py'
        * add the following:

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

    3. Activate virtual environment if you haven't already, then add necessary libraries
        a. source venv/bin/activate
        b. pip install flask

    4. Get all python package stuff and put into a requirements.txt
        a. pip freeze > requirements.txt
            - 'pip freeze' shows all installed packages
            - '>' pipes all installed packages into file called requirements.txt

    5. 'flask run' to test!
